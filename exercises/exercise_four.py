# Exercise 4: Simple String Reverser
#
# Write a Python function called `reverse_string` that takes one string
# argument and returns its reversed version.
#
# Example:
# reverse_string("hello")  # Expected output: "olleh"
# reverse_string("world")  # Expected output: "dlrow"
# reverse_string("")       # Expected output: ""
# reverse_string("a")      # Expected output: "a"
#
# Guidance for Tests (`tests/test_exercise_4.py`):
# - Test with a regular word.
# - Test with an empty string.
# - Test with a single character string.
# - Test with a string containing spaces.


def reverse_string(string: str) -> str:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 2: Sum of Two Numbers
#
# Write a Python function called `add_numbers` that takes two numerical
# arguments and returns their sum.
#
# Example:
# add_numbers(5, 3)   # Expected output: 8
# add_numbers(-2, 10)  # Expected output: 8
# add_numbers(0, 0)    # Expected output: 0
#
# Guidance for Tests (`tests/test_exercise_2.py`):
# - Test with two positive integers.
# - Test with a positive and a negative integer.
# - Test with two negative integers.
# - Test with zero.

# Exercise 1: Greeting Function
#
# Write a Python function called `greet` that takes one argument, a string
# representing a name, and returns a greeting message in the format
# "Hello, [name]!".
#
# Example:
# greet("Alice")  # Expected output: "Hello, Alice!"
# greet("Bob")    # Expected output: "Hello, Bob!"
#
# Guidance for Tests (`tests/test_exercise_1.py`):
# - Test with a typical name.
# - Test with an empty string as the name (what should happen?).
# - Test with a name containing numbers or special characters (how
#   should the function handle it based on the description?).


def greet(name: str) -> str:
    # Your code here
    pass
